        "Permutation importance analysis demonstrates that the duration of the last contact is by far the most influential feature for predicting deposit openings, followed by previous marketing outcomes and the time since last contact. Most demographic and financial features, including balance and marital status, have minimal or negative impact on model accuracy. The model relies primarily on contact duration and recent campaign history, while other variables play only a minor role."

We can see that increasing age and balance generally lead to higher predicted probabilities, while features such as housing and loan have a negative linear effect on the model’s predictions. For categorical variables like job, marital, education, and default, the relationship is more complex, but the overall patterns suggest that specific categories and higher values in some features can significantly influence the outcome."

        "The model predicts a high probability for the \"no deposit\" outcome and a low probability for \"yes.\" The main factors that decrease the likelihood of deposit opening are a low number of previous contacts, pdays, balance, and short campaign duration, along with younger age and absence of default. The presence of contact and housing features slightly increase the predicted probability of opening a deposit, but their influence is outweighed by the negative contributions of the other variables. Overall, the prediction is most strongly determined by recent campaign characteristics and client activity history."

        "Duration and poutcome are the most influential features for the model, with pdays and previous contacts also making notable contributions to prediction accuracy. In contrast, demographic and product-related features such as job, age, day, education, campaign, and housing show negative or near-zero importance, indicating limited impact on the model's decision-making process. This means the model relies primarily on recent client interactions and marketing outcomes rather than static client attributes. Overall, the results suggest that information about customer engagement during the campaign is most critical for predicting deposit opening."

        "Well, we can say that all models identify duration and recent campaign-related attributes, such as poutcome and pdays, as the most significant positive drivers for deposit opening. While SHAP, permutation importance, and ELI5 mostly agree on the top influential features, there are some differences in the ranking and in the identification of negatively contributing features, where demographic variables like job, age, and education appear most often. ELI5 and permutation model are atcually the same - just differs the goal of the model - one is more for vizualization (ELI5), but the results are the same as expected. \n",
